    <p>The beginnings of modern computational artificial intelligence can be traced back to the mid to late 20th century as basic machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks began to be developed. Even as early as the 1970, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine titled <i>"Medicine and the computer — the promise and problems of change"</i> [1] began to predict the promise that advanced computation might have on the field of medicine.
    </p>

    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
      <p><i>"Computing science will probably exert its major effects by augmenting and, in some cases, largely replacing the intellectual functions of the physician."</i> <br> -New England Journal of Medicine, 1970.</p>
      
    </div>

    <p>Now as a budding researcher and medical student, it is shocking to me that machine learning has not been more widely integrated into clinical practice, particularly when confronted with the shocking rates of medical mistakes that occur in hospitals nationwide. A widely cited 2016 study performed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University [2] found that medical errors might be the third leading cause of death in the US. While there has been some pushback against this figure due to the perhaps too simplistic approach the article takes, it is clear that too many lives are lost each year due to preventable medical mistakes. </p>

    <p>The breadth and severity of these mistakes is sometimes shocking (wrong site surgical procedures and retained surgical instruments come to mind), but even the rate at which incorrect diagnoses and treatments are delivered by physicians (estimated to be around 15% [3]) should be obvious problems for artificial intelligence to solve. For the remainder of this post I will investigate two reasons that might explain its failure to do so. </p>

    <h5>Lack of Data</h5>


    <h5>Privacy and Regulations</h5>
